# Air_Quality_Prediction
BDAD Summer 19: Air Quality Prediction


Models folder contains the 4 models we have tried
1) Random Forests
2) Deep Neural Networks
3) Support Vector Machines
4) Gradient Boosted Trees

General_scrips folder contains the python and scala scripts we wrote to download the data, load it in spark, clean it, join it and create features of it. 

We used Python only for downloading data from REST APIs. eg EPA Website or Google's Geo Reverse Encoding API.  

The results are shown in the paper and the slides attached to the project.
